          <h1>A General Understanding</h1>

          <p>Alright. If your here, I assume you are a complete begginer. Like just
            got on the title screen for the first time begginer. This section will focus mostly on the fundementals of what zomboid is,
            rather the more we go on the more specific things will get.

          <h2>What kind Of Game Am I Even Playing?</h2>
          <p>Zomboid is a isometric survival singler player focused game. You take control of a single lucky soul who has managed
            to be immune to a airborne zombie virus that has plagued the entire of knox country (where you play) and will most likely
            spread throughout the entire world. Though you are immune to the airbone variant zombie attacks can still infect you.
            <b>There. Is. No Cure.</b> Your gameplay will mostly focus around avoiding/killing zombies, prepping for the future
            and if you can manage the time, messing around with your new sandbox of a world. <b>THIS IS NOT LEFT 4 DEAD.
                THIS IS NOT THE WALKING DEAD OR ANY OTHER ACTION CENTERED ZOMBIE MEDIA.</b> In zomboid you are not the main character
                and any attempts at aura farming are going to resolt in death or frustration. If this turns you off the game, then dont play it.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Is this A Hard Game?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. Short answer is yes. Even if you get incredibly skilled and know to kill zombies in the
            most effecient way possible, you will most likely scew up, get to cocky, or lock yourself into death very easily.
            At the time of writing this I have over a 100 hours in this game and still cant get past power outages. I always mess up somewhere.
            This is probably just a side effect of me being stupid though, and youll probably manage fine with enough pracice.
          </p>

          <h2>Singleplayer Or Multiplayer</h2>
          <p>
            I would definetely reccomend playing singleplayer until you can confidently kill zomboids and know how to plan for
            the future. If your really that impatient and need to play this with friends <b>NOW</b>. Atleast do the 5 minute tutorial mentioned
            more later in this guide. If you dont, your going to start frustraited and drop the game almost immediatly. Dont be stupid. Also worth
            noting build 42 does not have online multiplayer currently.
          </p>

          <h2>Build 41 Or Build 42</h2>
          <p>
            At the time of writing zomboid is comprised of the now long stable update 41, and the very new unstable build 42.
            I reccomend switching to build 42. There can be some glitches and stuff is probbaly going to change alot midway through playthroughs,
            but the overall game is miles better and easier to pick up then Build 41. Heres some listed differences.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Build 42 has <b>3d animations</b> for way more things such as opening doors, carrying corpses, ragdolls ect...</li>
            <li>Build 42 has <b>reworked aiming</b> that is more fun and arcady but still forces you to learn to aim overtime with Skills
                (Ok fine you can act like rick grimes now.)
            </li>
            <li>
                A amazing <b>lighting rework</b> that makes zomboid feel more moody and interesting mostly at night.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Live animals</b> like rats, cows and deer. Big game changer for hunting and farming if thats your thing.
            </li>
            <li>
               Huge <b>Skyscrapers</b> and small <b>Basements</b>
            </li>
            <li>
               Build 42 has <b>NO MULTIPLAYER CURRENTLY.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
